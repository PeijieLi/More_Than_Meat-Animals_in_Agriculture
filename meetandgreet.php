It didn’t take much once we saw what was happening.\n\nIf you want to have a positive impact on a lot of different major issues in the world, and you want to make a change, you have to unlearn in order to grow. Unlearn a lot of social norms and question why do we do things a certain way, and what are the consequences of those decisions. I think people should not be so afraid to expose themselves to the truth. I think everyone should attend animal slaughters, and then decide if they still want to eat animals. Once they’ve seen it, and have made the decision, they don’t need to keep exposing themselves. I’m talking about adults here. They shouldn’t attempt to hide truths. They should care about the environment, and watch some documentaries. The other thing that annoys me is that people say, ‘Oh, there’s no science behind it,’ and then you hear the science comes out later. Sometimes, you gotta think for yourself.\n\nI think that with direct action social norms are disrupted, and the routine. A lot of people, what they do is destructive, and people don’t feel what the consequences are. So this exposes it. People seem more concerned about comfort than about watching scientific things. Demonstrations are good, in hopes that people will think about their actions, in hopes that they will take it to the next level on their own, or with support. A lot of people have told me that the community aspect here is really great.", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),
	array("Flexitarian", "R. S. M. @1st March 2018", "I probably wouldn’t eat lab-grown meat that replicates beef or chicken. Part of the reason I cut it out of my diet was like the ethics behind it and because I didn’t feel like I had the capacity to kill animals, like I know we talked about this before. But the other part of this is that I never really liked it. Even though my family still ate meat, it was never like, “Oh, they’re all eating meat, and now I feel so excluded. It was like, “Great, you eat what you like, I’ll eat what I like,” right? So even in that sense if this alternative was there, I don’t think it would be really appealing to me. I wouldn’t be opposed to trying it, because I have eaten meat in the past and I would be interested in comparing it. But I don’t think it’s like something I would be really interested in as a solution.\n\nThe alternative meats I’ve tried, I thought they were okay. They didn’t taste good or bad. But I did find it to be kind of freaky, like, I’ve eaten beef before by accident, and even when I was consuming it I was like, “Wow, this tastes like chicken.” It’s kind of a weird idea to wrap your head around, but for people who like do eat meat, I do think that it’s kind of a great opportunity to reconsider what you’re eating. Like for the longest time we’re told that eating animals is a decision that you make. Some people think it’s right; some people think that it’s wrong. Um, but now you’re introducing a new solution which gets you to the same finish line but with like, alternative means. So, I don’t know if it’s… I’m partially opposed to the idea because I think you’re giving people the satisfaction of feeling like they’ve consumed something that has been an animal, but it’s not. Does that make sense? It’s a very weird idea that I just thought about.\n\nIf you look at all the time and energy spent developing alternative meats, it kind of reminds me of… I wonder… If you look at the Silicon Valley, we’re like in a bubble, where people might be early adopters of something like this, but take it like a hundred miles south or 200 miles east. Would they even be open to that idea, or would they just get laughed at? Are we addressing a need or… ? Are we looking for a solution to the wrong problem?", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),
	array("Vegan", "R.H.", "I’ve definitely gotten negative feedback from friends and family. In the Bay, I guess people are more supportive or into it because you have DXE and so many animal rights groups and stuff like that. But in other places, you know, I’ve had family be like, “So when are you going to stop being vegan?” Like it’s just a fad or something like that. I’ve heard a lot of people. A lot of people, cause like I’ve been in Texas for a while, are like, “Oh, what’s veganism?” or like, “What about bacon?” or things like that. And they don’t really understand. There’s that disconnect. Um and at the same time, they’ll act like that, but then they’ll share videos on social media, like, “Oh, somebody hurt this dog!” or “Oh, watch this cow run free after being saved from a slaughterhouse,” and there’s just like this cognitive dissonance, but hopefully we can change that.", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),
    array("Vegan", "R.C.", "Initially I went vegan for environmental reasons. I watched Cowspiracy, and I like to think of myself as very environmentally aware, so if I hear there’s some issue and there are solutions to that problem, I do it. And yeah, Cowspiracy was a huge wake up call. I did not know that my consumption of cows, chickens, fish, and what not was having a huge impact on the environment. So I went vegan for that reason. Now, as I went through my journey of eating plant-based food and finding a community, here in Berkeley, at the Berkeley Animal Rights Center, you know, even now, it’s more for ethical reasons as well. Even if eating meat doesn’t have the same environmental impact, even if a plant-based diet and a meat-based diet are theoretically the same, I still can’t bring myself to eat a chicken knowing the violence involved in exploiting them. I see this as a lifestyle that I will continue forever.\n\nI think it is a social justice issue. I really think so. I can’t speak to whether it’s a feminist issue. You know, there are some people who claim that if you are a feminist, you would not consume dairy and eat any meat at all, because you know for that, you might want to ask why they would push, why they make those claims. But for me, it’s a social justice issue. I can compare my experiences with that of an animal in terms of me being viewed differently just because I’m of a certain ethnicity. I like to think that fundamentally, humans and non-human animals are the same. We all have families, we all feel joy, pain, have experiences of our own, are very self-aware. For us to see them as anything but, just as objects, or at best, pets… This form of speciesism is just, I think it’s just comparable to the type of -isms that certain marginalized groups would feel. I think it’s totally, in ways, comparable to other -isms: xenophobia, sexism, and what not. I think that needs to change. I’m glad animal rights groups such as Direct Action Everywhere, want to bring to attention these issues. \n\nThere are a lot of vegan Chinese stuff, in terms of mock meats as well. You just need to find them. They’re usually in large, Asian super markets. So fake goose, fake chicken, fake luncheon meat, everything. You would find it at Asian supermarkets. They would eat fake seafood. There’s a long history of vegetarianism in China. It has to do a lot with Buddhist teachings, you know, how we should live in harmony with others and not cause harm to others. You know, for a while, because of that, the vast majority of China was vegetarian. And the mock meats kind of reflected that. We were able to texture tofu and soy to make it in a way that is close to the animals we used to eat, but is not [meat]. Also, contemporarily, it’s still around because for Asian markets, there is a good Buddhist population. They would eat vegetarian, so there’s a huge demand for that. I’m not sure about Berkeley, but in San Francisco, in the Outer Richmond district, there’s a market that I regularly go to, and it has an entire section, a whole section dedicated entirely to vegan, vegetarian products. If I were to talk to them about vegetarianism and they were to be open to the idea, I would totally take them there and expose them to these different products. \n\nI think the hardest thing when talking to omnivores is getting them to make the connection that an animal is a living being. They’re not things. They’re not property for us to exploit. They are living beings with their own experiences, with moral value just like us. I can see how it’s very easy to not understand, because I used to be like that. I would be think, like, “Oh, there’s a pig, yeah, that’s cool,” you know? “It makes nice bacon.” Before I got involved with animal rights and the vegan lifestyle, I never spent time with a pig, or any animal, outside of pigeons. But since being involved with Direct Action Everywhere, learning about different animals when they are in a great environment, like a sanctuary, versus a not-so-great environment, I began to understand, going back: They’re just like us. If we were put in the situation that they are in currently, we would just be like, it would just be like 24 hour hell for us. It would be the same deal with my friends. I never ask, but I’ve known my friends for a long time, and I could tell you that none of them spent time with any of those animals: cows, pigs, chickens, fishes. They don’t know what they’re like. The only images they ever see them in are on a milk carton, or like in a chicken package, and on TV. But aside from that, you’re not going to be able to understand anything so far removed from, while unable to experience. That would be one of those difficult ways of being able to verbalize or have them internalize what your point is. \n\nI’ve been a vegan for over two years now. Specifically, since early January, 2016. Before that, I understood that at some level, the suffering of animals, when they were inside an industrial agricultural farm. For some reason, I didn’t understand the environmental impacts that they had. You know, otherwise I would have gone vegan a long time ago. Of course, now that I just told you I didn’t understand that, I know that they’re just as sentient and have just as much moral value as us. That is what kept me from being vegan, but also, a good part of what kept me from being vegan as well, is that as a person of color, I viewed it as a White thing. I thought that veganism is just this whole lifestyle that White people needed to take up to act like they’re better, whether that be in terms of being healthier or more morally better than us. I notice this now, but at the time I wasn’t put off by veganism at all. I was just put off by the animal rights movement, the culture of it, or at least the mainstream culture. A good part of it is the whole dog meat issue. I would be on social media or in public too, and if they see me… I used to work in a grocery store, and you know we would talk to customers, and they would just casually mention the topic to us in general. They wouldn’t say that I’m a dog-eater, but some of the things they would say would implicitly imply that I might. Just the way they would word their questions, or just the fact that they brought it up to me. Such as, “Oh, it’s just gross that dogs are being raised and eaten in China.” Strangers, who don’t even know me just think I’m an expert in this area, and think that like the country -- not even just the government or this backward groups of people in this small village -- but the whole country of China is eating dog meat. It’s rich coming from White people, especially if they’re meat eaters, because they don’t have any qualms about eating pigs who go through their own form of suffering and torture. Cows, chickens, same as well -- but dogs and cats, that’s what’s considered to be offensive and savagery -- that is what is off-putting for me about the mainstream animal rights movement, but veganism as well for a while.", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),

    array("Vegan", "A.T. @1st March 2018", "I’ve been vegetarian for five years. The main thing that made me go vegan was my skin. I had already wanted to go vegan, but I didn’t have the willpower and I felt like I just wasn’t educated enough or doing enough for the animals. So I started looking up ways to clear acne and one of them was to cut out dairy and I was like, well that ties into me wanting to go vegan anyway, so from there I started researching how the dairy industry ties into the meat industry. From there I learned about capitalist factory farming and how protein is recycled through plants and all that stuff so I actually went vegan I was the first one in my family to go vegan. For me, it was just a little bit harder just because when I went vegetarian I really depended on dairy and bread. That was my diet inside the house, and toast with avocado on it. I was really lucky in that my mom is a very strong feminist and progressive Latina. Feminism and speciesism are so interconnected. I sat down and watched documentaries with my mom and my sister, and they totally supported me in my veganism. My grandma on the other hand, absolutely shit on me for what I was eating and what I did. She thinks I’m crazy for going vegan and my mom is the worst mom ever for letting me do it. She likes that I’m cooking more, like I make these recipes and she’s like, “Is this really vegan?” But every time she comes over she’s saying, “You NEED cheese,” and I’m like, “No, look at my skin, it’s a lot better; it’s really good.” She’s always going to have that traditional mindset of meat =  having really strong bones. And when the other side of my family comes over it’s kind of embarrassing because like half my family is vegan. On my dad’s birthday, my uncles came over and it was a little bit weird serving all vegan food. They all liked it, but it was weird because they all felt a little bit hungry after, and it was supposed to be very filling. I still feel a little bit embarrassed because my family members still think of it as stupid, like “what are you doing?", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),
    array("Vegan", "T.J.", "I went vegan for the animals, number one. I started watching Netflix documentaries. I was already eating vegetarian and pescatarian before I went full vegan, like all the way. It was definitely the information that was online. Like if you just read it, if you just look at it, that’s all you need. If you see it and you don’t do anything about it, I think you’re just being selfish at that point. And taking your own body into accord, it is better for you. Like they have studies. Everything you need is there for you. And people are like, “I just can’t stop.” You have no self control then. If people can’t stop then they’re undisciplined. But like I was going to say that before I was mainly eating vegetarian for most of, I would say, the past ten years, I’ve been eating vegetarian. Then once in a while, if I’m at a family thing, and I can’t get around not eating, like I can’t not eat at my aunt’s house who’s invited me over and there’s like 50 people there. But now it doesn’t matter because I don’t even go to those events anymore because I am gay. So I don’t even get the invite. So, perfect! That’s fine.\n\nIt’s too bad that they aren’t [educating] kids on this issue when they’re young. Why aren’t those options even available to kids who are in elementary school or junior high, or high school? But also, I don’t think that being vegan was as mainstream back then. There wasn’t as much access, whereas now we have the internet so that knowledge is global. You’re friends with someone and all of a sudden they share something and it shares with your friends, so how many people did that reach to? I just wish there were options for that, because I could have been doing this a long time ago. Now I have to go backwards, and try to re-fix everything that I’ve been -- That’s the other thing too, like my mom is an immigrant. She doesn’t understand the difference between organic and [regular] meat. She used to kill the goat in the backyard and then eat it. She doesn’t understand, like, if you buy meat from Costco, who knows how long this has been sitting out? Who knows how many hormones are in it? She doesn’t get it. So now she’s like getting organic produce, just to like -- I mean there’s nothing wrong with it if you don’t have money, but I’m like, “Mom, your health or money? Which is better for you?” She still has the immigrant mentality of trying to penny pinch, and still like still leaves the cover on the lamp, the plastic. Like super-preservation for everything. You need to enjoy your shit! What’s the point of having stuff if you can’t enjoy it? It’s funny.", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),
    array("Flexitarian", "J.K. @1st March 2018", "I can only say, for me, when it comes to vegetarianism, there’s certain beliefs where it’s like, “Okay, that’s definitely a valid reason to be a vegetarian.” The sustainability of  it is definitely something I agree with. Just because all the resources it takes to raise plants versus animals. Um, that’s the one I tend to agree with the most. And also, it’s like with plants, from an ethical standpoint, in terms of raising plants, it’s a lot easier to do in a more industrial style, than say, animals, which you can just crowd together and they’re not going to get sick. There’s definitely less processing that needs to go into plants than animals. So from that point, yeah, that’s valid. The one that I don’t like is when people try and get really… When people start saying, “Oh, it’s an animal, it’s like, because it’s an animal, that taking its life is more… like its life is more valuable than a plant’s life,” is how some people come off as, and that’s not something I agree with. I think life is life, period. Um, and the reality is, unless you’re a plant, you need to consume something that was once alive in order to live. Unless you want to go on that Funion diet, because I’m sure there is nothing that once was living in a funion. It’s not as cracked up as it’s supposed to be, so I’ve heard. It seems like a very… People who are very expressive I find tend to be a little self-righteous, you know, “Hey, I’m better than you because I do this.” It’s like, “No, man, life is life, period. If we didn’t have plants we couldn’t breathe.” And then, sometimes it just goes too far, like I kid you not dude, one of my Facebook friends once posted he was looking to start a diet of completely nothing once living, including bacteria cultures, and I’m just like, -- I didn’t say anything, but I’m just like, “You do realize everything we eat was once living, right? You can’t --  And she was totally earnest. The way it’s also, I find, a little naive.

Going vegan seemed like the next natural step, so my sister and I both went vegan around the same time. Even in Jainism, the reason people drank milk in the first place is that they had a village cow and people would milk it. Cuz it’s old timey. But today, it’s obvious. If Jainism was updated to modern day, it would be vegan. So since I culturally follow Jainism, it’s obvious. And I think that’s the same reason Karishma (the interviewee’s sister) went vegan. \n\nGrowing up, kids used to throw meat in my food. The struggle is hardcore. I used to get legit panic attacks when my mom didn’t bring the food. She was the campus supervisor, right, so she’d be like, “Oh, I’ll bring you food.” Like, “Oh, I’ll bring you food when I bring it.” So I wouldn’t take my lunch to school, I’d just get it fresh from my mom. So when she wasn’t there, I freaked out. Like I’d literally start crying. Or when, um, when we used to go out for Girl Scout Trips and stuff, it was like, “Oh no, another plate of spaghetti! Who knows what’s in there?” Like I just had a lot of anxiety around food, without my mom there. Like when she was there, I was fine. But like the second she wasn’t there, even up until high school, I like freaked out when my mom wasn’t there and I didn’t have food. Scary.\n\nNow, now it’s even more restricting, because I can’t go to a restaurant and there’s be like one, there’ll usually be like one vegetarian option and even if it has eggs I’d be like, “Eh,” you know, cause like, restaurants, you know? But now it’s even more restricting because I can’t have that. I can’t go to In ‘N’ Out, which is like, “What is my life now?” And talk about how I have to order the very specific, very custom order, you know? I definitely go out to eat less. And I don’t really go out with friends, cause it’s like, “Ugh!” People don’t want to go to a vegan restaurant. As a vegetarian, I could always be the one compromising, but as a vegan, there’s not really a chance of compromising anymore. You have to be the one that’s okay with not going to a vegan restaurant, and like, people are pissy. When Karishma and I, uh, you know like during graduation I was there with all her friends? Um so we went to the Butcher’s Son, right, and we were trying to get in and one of her friends was like, “Oh wait, this is a vegan restaurant? No thanks!” and left, and half of them left to get food, over there, and half of us stayed to get food over here… I love the Philly Cheesesteak. Did you hear that they’re expanding? They’re finally going to get a bigger restaurant, thank God! But see that’s easier in Berkeley right? Because you can go like down the street and there’s another restaurant.

    array("Vegan", "M.C.", "For me, going vegan was all about animal rights. I was interested in the health side of it, too, eating healthy, and preventing diseases and illnesses. I started out vegetarian first, and that was only because I wanted to prevent cruelty, and I thought about eggs and dairy. At the same time, I was also learning about the harm that eggs and dairy do to our health as well. So it was multiple reasons, but primarily for animal rights, and then for health as well.\n\nWe’ve created a world that is in desperate need of healing and peace. We can only make that happen by being willing to live nonviolently--interactions, they are total--and the way we talk to each other as well. As long as we treat non-human animals as less deserving of freedom and lives that they choose for themselves, we’re not going to experience true love, peace, and healing. Which is why by denying their rights, we’re denying the rights of every sentient being, including ourselves. \n\nBeing vegan takes me back to my roots… I’m actually kind of proud of it, because even though I don’t blend in--I feel like I still insult people I talk to, I inspire some, too. They get more motivated to do things that they’re passionate about, such as helping children, helping people with cancer, homelessness, things like that. I feel like when they see somebody active, they feel like, ‘Hey, maybe I can do something about the things that I’m passionate about, too.’\n\nNow I’m an activist because of all the extreme cruelty that is happening. When I think about if that was happening to me, I would want somebody to take action and do something for me right now, and speak out for me, and basically just be very direct about it, and actually take action. So that’s why it’s important to me. I feel like direct action really elevates the animals’ voices and their point of view, not that we truly understand their point of view, but just thinking, “If we were in their place, what would we want?” It also inspires others to take action, so it’s contagious. When you take action and when you do something that maybe society is not used to seeing, or maybe it’s something that they’ve been wanting to do, but they didn’t have a lot of support, when they [other people] see you doing it, they are also inclined and empowered to take action.
