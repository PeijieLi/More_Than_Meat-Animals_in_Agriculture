I started out vegetarian first, and that was only because I wanted to prevent cruelty, and I thought about eggs and dairy. At the same time, I was also learning about the harm that eggs and dairy do to our health as well. So it was multiple reasons, but primarily for animal rights, and then for health as well.", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),
	array("Flexitarian", "R. S. M. @1st March 2018", "I probably wouldn’t eat lab-grown meat that replicates beef or chicken. Part of the reason I cut it out of my diet was like the ethics behind it and because I didn’t feel like I had the capacity to kill animals, like I know we talked about this before. But the other part of this is that I never really liked it. Even though my family still ate meat, it was never like, “Oh, they’re all eating meat, and now I feel so excluded. It was like, “Great, you eat what you like, I’ll eat what I like,” right? So even in that sense if this alternative was there, I don’t think it would be really appealing to me. I wouldn’t be opposed to trying it, because I have eaten meat in the past and I would be interested in comparing it. But I don’t think it’s like something I would be really interested in as a solution.", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),

    array("Vegan", "A.T. @1st March 2018", "I’ve been vegetarian for five years. The main thing that made me go vegan was my skin. I had already wanted to go vegan, but I didn’t have the willpower and I felt like I just wasn’t educated enough or doing enough for the animals. So I started looking up ways to clear acne and one of them was to cut out dairy and I was like, well that ties into me wanting to go vegan anyway, so from there I started researching how the dairy industry ties into the meat industry. From there I learned about capitalist factory farming and how protein is recycled through plants and all that stuff so I actually went vegan I was the first one in my family to go vegan. For me, it was just a little bit harder just because when I went vegetarian I really depended on dairy and bread. That was my diet inside the house, and toast with avocado on it. I was really lucky in that my mom is a very strong feminist and progressive Latina. Feminism and speciesism are so interconnected. I sat down and watched documentaries with my mom and my sister, and they totally supported me in my veganism. My grandma on the other hand, absolutely shit on me for what I was eating and what I did. She thinks I’m crazy for going vegan and my mom is the worst mom ever for letting me do it. She likes that I’m cooking more, like I make these recipes and she’s like, “Is this really vegan?” But every time she comes over she’s saying, “You NEED cheese,” and I’m like, “No, look at my skin, it’s a lot better; it’s really good.” She’s always going to have that traditional mindset of meat =  having really strong bones. And when the other side of my family comes over it’s kind of embarrassing because like half my family is vegan. On my dad’s birthday, my uncles came over and it was a little bit weird serving all vegan food. They all liked it, but it was weird because they all felt a little bit hungry after, and it was supposed to be very filling. I still feel a little bit embarrassed because my family members still think of it as stupid, like “what are you doing?", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),
    array("Flexitarian", "J.K. @1st March 2018", "I can only say, for me, when it comes to vegetarianism, there’s certain beliefs where it’s like, “Okay, that’s definitely a valid reason to be a vegetarian.” The sustainability of  it is definitely something I agree with. Just because all the resources it takes to raise plants versus animals. Um, that’s the one I tend to agree with the most. And also, it’s like with plants, from an ethical standpoint, in terms of raising plants, it’s a lot easier to do in a more industrial style, than say, animals, which you can just crowd together and they’re not going to get sick. There’s definitely less processing that needs to go into plants than animals. So from that point, yeah, that’s valid. The one that I don’t like is when people try and get really… When people start saying, “Oh, it’s an animal, it’s like, because it’s an animal, that taking its life is more… like its life is more valuable than a plant’s life,” is how some people come off as, and that’s not something I agree with. I think life is life, period. Um, and the reality is, unless you’re a plant, you need to consume something that was once alive in order to live. Unless you want to go on that Funion diet, because I’m sure there is nothing that once was living in a funion. It’s not as cracked up as it’s supposed to be, so I’ve heard. It seems like a very… People who are very expressive I find tend to be a little self-righteous, you know, “Hey, I’m better than you because I do this.” It’s like, “No, man, life is life, period. If we didn’t have plants we couldn’t breathe.” And then, sometimes it just goes too far, like I kid you not dude, one of my Facebook friends once posted he was looking to start a diet of completely nothing once living, including bacteria cultures, and I’m just like, -- I didn’t say anything, but I’m just like, “You do realize everything we eat was once living, right? You can’t --  And she was totally earnest. The way it’s also, I find, a little naive. But I mean, I can… The meaning behind it is good because life is important, but at the same time, let’s be realistic here.", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),
	array("Local Butcher", "Monica Rocchino", "Meat is a luxury item. It’s seasonal. It's not something you need on your plate everyday. When you eat it you should just eat a little, the best you can afford is really the key.", "img/meatgreet/local_butcher.png"),
    array("Vegan", "G.S. @1st March 2018", "The main thing for me was concern for the environment. Being an environmental science major, you learn a lot about the contributions of animal products to environmental degradation, land how bad food systems really are.", "img/team/no-image.jpeg"),
    array("Flexitarian", "R.S.M. @1st March 2018", "The alternative meats I’ve tried, I thought they were okay. They didn’t taste good or bad. But I did find it to be kind of freaky, like, I’ve eaten beef before by accident, and even when I was consuming it I was like, “Wow, this tastes like chicken.” It’s kind of a weird idea to wrap your head around, but for people who like do eat meat, I do think that it’s kind of a great opportunity to reconsider what you’re eating. Like for the longest time we’re told that eating animals is a decision that you make. Some people think it’s right; some people think that it’s wrong. Um, but now you’re introducing a new solution which gets you to the same finish line but with like, alternative means. So, I don’t know if it’s… I’m partially opposed to the idea because I think you’re giving people the satisfaction of feeling like they’ve consumed something that has been an animal, but it’s not. Does that make sense? It’s a very weird idea that I just thought about.

Like I rarely ate it,  because my mom has always tried to keep us on a vegetarian diet like since we were little. But sometimes she did feed us meat. I think that was the hardest for me, pork. I like making pulled pork sandwiches and stuff like that. But I’m not really into all the alternative stuff. I rather have a bowl of rice and beans and just veggies on top. I do have asthma, but since I became vegan I didn’t have to use an inhaler. I think it’s awesome. I feel better.
