		Today we will be discussing Prevent Cruelty California, a bill intended to close the loopholes that 
		were left open on Proposition 2. Proposition 2, which passed in 2008, aimed to outlaw battery cages in California factory farms, 
		and mandated that animals kept at these facilities must, at a minimum, be granted sufficient 
		space to stretch, turn around, and lie down. However, since the passage of the proposition, the 
		California Department of Food and Agriculture has taken no measures to enforce the law prescribed 
		by Proposition 2. Hence, many animal welfare organizations, and their allies, have led a canvassing 
		campaign. As of April 24th, Prevent Cruelty California has received over 600,000 signatures, ensuring 
		that a spot for the Bill on the November 2018 ballot. Then it will be up to Californian Voters to 
		decide if they want the bill to pass or not.

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello, welcome to another episode of More than Meat. Today, we are going to explore the history 
		of federal food safety laws and identify human health as a driving point for livestock-related 
		legislation. Many of the federal laws pertaining animal agriculture are related to food safety. 
		This is understandably the case, as most people are concerned about the health implications of 
		what they are eating, especially considering of the risk of food poisoning.<br><br><br><br>

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello, I’m Heliya Izadpanah, and you’re listening to More Than Meat, a podcast series on Animal 
		Agriculture legislation. Today we will be discussing antibiotic use on factory farms, their impact 
		on human populations, and relevant lobbying and legislation. <br>
		The majority of antibiotics on the market today are used on “farm” animals living in factory farms. 
		These drugs are not administered to the animals because they are ill. Rather, they are injected 
		into each individual to serve as growth promoters. Enhanced growth means more money for per animal, 
		so animals are made to grow bigger and faster than what is natural. In addition, these antibiotics 
		are used to protect the animals from the filthy conditions they are forced to live in. Animals are 
		crammed together in bloody, feces covered spaces with open wounds and little room to move. Disease 
		runs rampant in factory farms.

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is More Than Meat, I’m Alicia Lai. Previously, we explored in depth about the problematic 
		treatment of animals and workers in the current meat industry. You may be wondering what you could 
		do as a consumer to address these issues. This is a complex question with many different answers. 
		One solution is to support your local butcher. In this podcast, we interviewed Monica Rocchino, 
		the owner of The Local Butcher Shop in Berkeley, to learn more about what that means.
