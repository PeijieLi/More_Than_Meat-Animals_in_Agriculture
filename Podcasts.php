		<br>Hi! My name is Bri, and you’re listening to More than Meat. More than Meat is a podcast 
		series that explores the ins and outs of animal welfare legislation. In the next few episodes, we will be looking 
		at different laws related to animal welfare and animal agriculture. This series seeks to interrogate the meat industry 
		through a legislative framework. We will take a closer look at different components of the livestock industry and related 
		laws to determine implications for human health, environmental sustainability, labor conditions, and animal welfare. Naturally, 
		many of the laws and topics we will focus on are directly related to animal welfare; however, we plan on identifying and elaborating 
		on how these laws are connected to health, the environment, and labor. We have conducted interviews with public policy experts, 
		students, animal rights activists, and grassroots organizers to understand the full picture on how animal rights legislation is 
		perceived. We also distributed a survey to gather information about what motivates people to vote on animal welfare legislation. 
		Ultimately, More than Meat seeks to interrogate the current livestock industry and determine whether the current system is working 
		in terms of human health, environmental sustainability, labor conditions, and animal welfare. We’ll also examine the barriers to 
		effective animal welfare legislation. Through More than Meat, we hope to educate our listeners about challenges in formulating 
		effective animal welfare legislation that protects animals raised for consumption, human health, livestock industry workers, and 
		the environment.

		<br>Hello, welcome to another episode of More than Meat. Today, we are going to explore the history 
		of federal food safety laws and identify human health as a driving point for livestock-related 
		legislation. Many of the federal laws pertaining animal agriculture are related to food safety. 
		This is understandably the case, as most people are concerned about the health implications of

		<p><font color="white">
		<br>Hello, I’m Heliya Izadpanah, and you’re listening to More Than Meat, a podcast series on Animal 
		Agriculture legislation. Today we will be discussing antibiotic use on factory farms, their impact 
		on human populations, and relevant lobbying and legislation. <br>
		The majority of antibiotics on the market today are used on “farm” animals living in factory farms. 
		These drugs are not administered to the animals because they are ill. Rather, they are injected 
		into each individual to serve as growth promoters. Enhanced growth means more money for per animal, 
		so animals are made to grow bigger and faster than what is natural. In addition, these antibiotics 
		are used to protect the animals from the filthy conditions they are forced to live in. Animals are 
		crammed together in bloody, feces covered spaces with open wounds and little room to move. Disease 
		runs rampant in factory farms.

		One solution is to support your local butcher. In this podcast, we interviewed Monica Rocchino,

		<p><font color="white">
		<br>The Humane Slaughter Act became effective on August 27, 1958. The overall goal of the act was to decrease 
		suffering of livestock during slaughter. The act requires that “all animals are rendered insensible to pain by a single blow or 
		gunshot or an electrical, chemical or other means that is rapid and effective, before being shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut.” 
		The methods for sedation differ according to the size of the animal. For example, bovines are much larger than most livestock and thusly, 
		require electronarcosis, which is essentially direct electrical stunning. The act itself does not mention specific methods, but rather 
		offers a general method and therefore, authorizes the U.S Department of Agriculture to create more specific regulations on humane methods 
		of slaughter.<br>

		<br>I’m Bri, and you’re listening to More than Meat. In this episode, we will be discussing lobbying in animal 
		welfare legislation in the state of California. Who are the big players? What industries are being represented? Most importantly, 
		is lobbying preventing the establishment of effective animal welfare legislation? Today we will be examining the different players 
		that lobby for and against animal agriculture legislation. Many of the big players for animal welfare are names you would probably 
		recognize - The Humane Society and ASPCA, among others. These organizations use advocacy, grassroots organizing, and other tools to 
		work with legislators to promote protections for animals. After, we’ll look at some of the industries that lobby against the creation 
		of animal welfare legislation. These industries are grounded in economic interest, not ideology, an interesting dichotomy with the animal 
		advocacy groups. Finally, we’ll conclude with an evaluation of whether interests groups are preventing the establishment of 
		effective animal agriculture legislation.
